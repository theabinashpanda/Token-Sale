# Token Sale Project

This project aims to implement a token sale for an ERC20 token with specific functionalities as outlined in the assignment. The goal is to raise funds of 2 ETH by selling ERC20 tokens to investors.

## Project Description
- Investors can participate in the token sale by sending ETH.
- Upon purchase, tokens are immediately distributed to the respective investors. 
- The token sale automatically stops once the minimum fundraising goal of 2 ETH is achieved, and further token sale is disallowed.
- Additionally, the token sale concludes after 32 blocks are produced post-contract deployment. 
- After the token sale ends, there's a provision to transfer all ETH from the smart contract to a specific external address.
- This project ensures a streamlined process for fundraising through token sale while maintaining security and efficiency.
